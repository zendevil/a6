 * mm-naive.c - The fastest, least memory-efficient malloc package.
 * 
 * In this naive approach, a block is allocated by simply incrementing
 * the brk pointer.  A block is pure payload. There are no headers or
 * footers.  Blocks are never coalesced or reused. Realloc is
 * implemented directly using mm_malloc and mm_free.
 *
 * NOTE TO STUDENTS: Replace this header comment with your own header
 * comment that gives a high level description of your solution.
